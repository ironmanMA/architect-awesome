[](#树)tree
----------

### [](#二叉树)Binary tree

Each node has a maximum of two leaf nodes.

*   [Binary Tree](https://blog.csdn.net/cai2016/article/details/52589952)

### [](#完全二叉树)Complete Binary Tree

*   [Complete Binary Tree](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E4%BA%8C%E5%8F%89%E6%A0%91/7773232?fr=aladdin)
    *   The leaf nodes can only appear at the bottom and sub-lower levels, and the nodes at the bottom level are all concentrating on the binary tree at the leftmost position of the layer.

### [](#平衡二叉树)Balanced binary tree

The absolute value of the height difference between the left and right two subtrees does not exceed one, and both the left and right subtrees are balanced binary trees.

*   ["On Algorithms and Data Structures: Nine Balanced Search Trees for Red and Black Trees"](http://www.cnblogs.com/yangecnu/p/Introduce-Red-Black-Tree.html)

### [](#b-bb树)B-, B+, B* trees

MySQL is based on the B+ tree clustered index organization table

*   ["B-tree, B+ tree, B* tree"](https://blog.csdn.net/aqzwss/article/details/53074186)
*   ["Comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of B-trees, B+ trees and B* trees"](https://blog.csdn.net/bigtree_3721/article/details/73632405)
    *   The tree structure of the leaf nodes of the B+ tree is more convenient than the B-tree for scanning and range retrieval.

### [](#lsm-树)LSM tree

Compared with B+ trees, LSM (Log-Structured Merge-Trees) sacrifices partial read performance in exchange for write performance (through batch writes) and achieves read and write. Hbase, LevelDB, Tair (Long DB), and nessDB use the structure of the LSM tree. LSM can quickly establish an index.

*   [LSM Tree vs B+ Tree](https://blog.csdn.net/dbanote/article/details/8897599)
    
    *   The B+ tree read performance is good, but due to the need for an orderly structure, the disk seeks frequently when the keys are scattered, resulting in write performance.
    *   LSM divides a large tree into N small trees, first writes to memory (without seeking problems, high performance), and constructs an ordered small tree (ordered tree) in memory. The bigger the memory tree is flushed to disk. When reading, because it does not know which tree the data is on, it is necessary to traverse (bi-search) all the small trees, but the data is ordered inside each small tree.
*   [LSM Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree Storage Engine)](https://blog.csdn.net/u014774781/article/details/52105708)
    
    *   In extreme terms, the write performance of HBase based on the LSM tree is an order of magnitude higher than that of MySQL, and the read performance is an order of magnitude lower.
    *   Optimization method: Bloom filter replaces binary search; compact decimal tree, improves query performance.
    *   In Hbase, when the memory reaches a certain threshold, the entire flush flushes to disk and forms a file (B+ number). HDFS does not support the update operation. Therefore, Hbase does an overall flush instead of a merge update. Flush to the small tree on the disk, periodically merged into a big tree.

[](#bitset)BitSet
-----------------

It is often used for checking the weight of large-scale data.

*   ["Java Bitset Class"](http://www.runoob.com/java/java-bitset-class.html)

----------------------

Commonly used for big data, such as email, url, etc. Core principle: Generate a fingerprint (a byte or bytes, but certainly a lot less than the original data) by calculating each piece of data, each of which is obtained by random calculation, mapping the fingerprint to a large The bitwise storage space. Note: There will be a certain error rate. Advantages: High space and time efficiency. Disadvantages: As the number of deposited elements increases, the miscalculation rate increases.

### [](#事务-acid-特性)Transaction ACID features

*   ["Database ACID Features"](https://blog.csdn.net/u012440687/article/details/52116108)

### [](#事务的隔离级别)Transaction isolation level

*   Uncommitted read: A transaction can read another uncommitted data and is prone to dirty reads.
    
*   Read submission: A transaction can read data only after another transaction has been submitted, but a non-repeatable read situation occurs (the read data is inconsistent), and an UPDATE operation occurs during the read process. (The default level for most databases is RC, such as SQL Server, Oracle), which cannot be changed when reading.
    
*   Repeatable reading: The same transaction ensures that the same data is obtained for each read, but does not guarantee that the original data is updated (phantom read) by other transactions. Mysql InnoDB is this level.
    
*   Serialization: serial processing of all things (sacrificing efficiency)
    
*   [Understanding the Four Isolation Levels of a Business](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_33290787/article/details/51924963)

### [](#mvcc)MVCC

*   ["\[mysql\] some understanding of MVCC in innodb"](https://www.cnblogs.com/chenpingzhao/p/5065316.html)
    
    *   The MVCC in innodb is used at the Repeatable-Read isolation level.
    *   MVCC produces phantom issues (updated exceptions.)
*   ["Easy understanding MYSQL MVCC implementation mechanism"](https://blog.csdn.net/whoamiyang/article/details/51901888)
    
    *   MVCC control is achieved by hiding the version column, a record creation time, a record deletion time, and the time
    *   Only operate on lines that are smaller (or equal) than the current version.

[](#锁)lock
----------

### [](#java中的锁和同步类)Locks and synchronization classes in Java

*   ["Lock Classification in Java"](https://www.cnblogs.com/qifengshi/p/6831055.html)
    
    *   Mainly includes synchronized, ReentrantLock, and ReadWriteLock.
*   ["Java Concurrency AQS Detailed"](https://www.cnblogs.com/waterystone/p/4920797.html)
    
*   ["Signal Semaphore in Java"](http://cuisuqiang.iteye.com/blog/2020146)
    
    *   Quantity control
    *   Apply with acquire, apply for not blocked; release with release.
*   ["Mutex vs Semaphore in Java Development"](https://www.cnblogs.com/davidwang456/p/6094947.html)
    
    *   Simply put, Mutex is exclusive. Only one resource can be obtained. Semaphore is also exclusive, but it can define multiple objects that can be accessed.

### [](#公平锁--非公平锁)Fair lock & non-fair lock

The role of the fair lock is to execute in strict accordance with the order in which the threads are started, and no other thread is allowed to queue execution; non-fair locks are allowed to be queued.

*   [Fair and Unfair Locks](https://blog.csdn.net/EthanWhite/article/details/55508357)
    *   ReentrantLock and synchronized are both non-fair locks by default. ReentrantLock can be set to fair lock.

### [](#悲观锁)Pessimistic lock

Pessimistic locking, if used improperly (with too many locks), can cause large areas of service to wait. It is recommended to use optimistic locking + retries first.

*   ["\[MySQL\] Pessimistic Lock & Optimistic Lock"](https://www.cnblogs.com/zhiqian-ali/p/6200874.html)
    
    *   Optimistic locking method: version number + retry method
    *   Pessimistic locking: row locking via select ... for update (unreadable, non-writable, and share lock read-unreadable).
*   ["Mysql query statement using select.. for update database deadlock analysis"](https://www.cnblogs.com/Lawson/p/5008741.html)
    
    *   Although the innodb storage engine oracle's intrinsic lock is a lock line, it is internally locked.
    *   Different index conditions that lock the same data can cause deadlocks.
*   ["Mysql concurrent classic deadlock causes and solutions"](https://www.cnblogs.com/zejin2008/p/5262751.html)
    

### [](#乐观锁--cas)Optimistic Lock & CAS

*   ["An Optimistic Lock Implementation - CAS"](http://www.importnew.com/20472.html)
    *   It is similar to the MySQL optimistic lock method, but it is compared with the original value.

### [](#aba-问题)ABA issues

Due to high concurrency, under CAS, this A may not be A after updating. It can be solved by the version number, similar to the optimistic lock mentioned in Mysql above.

*   [Java CAS and ABA Issues](https://www.cnblogs.com/549294286/p/3766717.html)
*   ["ABA Problems and Avoidance in Java"](https://blog.csdn.net/li954644351/article/details/50511879)
    *   AtomicStampedReference and AtomicStampedReference.

### [](#copyonwrite容器)CopyOnWrite container

Concurrent reads can be made to the CopyOnWrite container without the need for locking. The CopyOnWrite concurrent container is used to read multiple writes and fewer concurrent scenes. For example, whitelists, blacklists, and visits and update scenarios for product categories are not suitable for scenarios that require strong data consistency.

*   ["Copy-On-Write Map Implementation in JAVA"](https://www.cnblogs.com/hapjin/p/4840107.html)
    
    *   Reading and writing are separated, reading occurs on the original data, and writing occurs on the copy.
    *   Without locking, consistency is finally achieved through consistency.
*   [Chat Concurrency - Copy-On-Write Container in Java](https://blog.csdn.net/a494303877/article/details/53404623)
    

### [](#ringbuffer)RingBuffer

*   ["Thread-safe, lock-free RingBuffer implementation \[a read thread, a write thread\]"](http://www.cnblogs.com/l00l/p/4115001.html)

### [](#可重入锁--不可重入锁)Reentrant Locks & Non-Reentrant Locks

*   [Reentrant and Non-Reentrant Locks](https://www.cnblogs.com/dj3839/p/6580765.html)
    
    *   Examples of reentrant locks and non-reentrant locks are illustrated by simple code.
    *   Reentrant locks mean that the same thread can regain previously acquired locks.
    *   Reentrant locks allow users to avoid deadlocks.
    *   Reentrant locks in Java: synchronized and java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock
*   ["ReenTrantLock reentrant lock (and the difference between synchronized) summary"](https://www.cnblogs.com/baizhanshi/p/7211802.html)
    
    *   Synchronized easy to use, the compiler to lock, is a non-fair lock.
    *   ReenTrantLock is flexible and lock fairness can be customized.
    *   In the same locked scenario, it is recommended to use synchronized.

### [](#互斥锁--共享锁)Mutexes & shared locks

Mutexes: Only one thread can acquire a lock at the same time. For example, ReentrantLock is a mutex, and write locks in ReadWriteLock are mutexes. Shared locks: There can be multiple or simultaneous locks. For example, Semaphore, CountDownLatch are shared locks, and read locks in ReadWriteLock are shared locks.

    *   Thread scheduling is the responsibility of the operating system. Coroutine scheduling is the responsibility of the program.
    *   Compared with threads, coroutines reduce unnecessary operating system switching.
    *   In fact, when switching to an IO operation is more meaningful, (because the IO operation does not occupy the CPU), if no IO operation is encountered, switch according to the time slice.

[](#设计模式的六大原则)Six principles of design patterns
-----------------------------------------------

*   [The Six Principles of Design Patterns](https://blog.csdn.net/q291611265/article/details/48465113)
    *   The principle of opening and closing: open to the extension, close to the modification, use more abstract classes and interfaces.
    *   Lie substitution principle: the base class can be replaced by subclasses, use abstract class inheritance, do not use concrete class inheritance.
    *   Relying on the principle of reversal: to rely on abstraction, not relying on the specific, programming for the interface, not for programming.
    *   Interface isolation principle: Using multiple isolated interfaces is better than using a single interface to establish a minimal interface.
    *   Dimit's Law: A software entity should interact with other entities as little as possible and establish links through intermediate classes.
    *   Synthetic reuse principles: Use synthetic/aggregate as much as possible instead of using inheritance.

[](#应用场景)Application scenario
-----------------------------

*   ["Detailed Design Patterns in the JDK"](http://blog.jobbole.com/62314/)
    
    *   Structural mode:
        
        *   Adapter: Used to convert an interface to another interface, such as java.util.Arrays#asList().
        *   Bridge mode: This mode decouples the implementation of abstract and abstract operations, so that the abstraction and implementation can be independently changed, such as JDBC;
        *   Combined mode: Makes the client seem to have the same combination of individual objects and objects. In other words, a certain type of method also accepts its own type as parameters, such as Map.putAll, List.addAll, Set.addAll.
        *   Decorator pattern: Dynamically adds an extra function to an object, which is an alternative to subclasses, such as java.util.Collections#checkedList|Map|Set|SortedSet|SortedMap.
        *   Fragmentation mode: use caching to speed up the access time of a large number of small objects, such as valueOf(int).
        *   Proxy mode: The proxy mode is to replace a complex or time-consuming object with a simple object, such as java.lang.reflect.Proxy
    *   Create mode:
        
        *   Abstract factory pattern: The abstract factory pattern provides a protocol to generate a series of related or independent objects without specifying the concrete object type, such as java.util.Calendar#getInstance().
        *   Builder: A new class is defined to build an instance of another class to simplify the creation of complex objects such as: java.lang.StringBuilder#append().
        *   Factory method: that **a return** \* back to the specific object methods, rather than several, such as java.lang.Object # toString (), java.lang.Class # newInstance ().
        *   Prototype mode: Makes an instance of a class generate its own copy, such as: java.lang.Object#clone().
        *   Singleton mode: There is only one instance globally, such as java.lang.Runtime#getRuntime().
    *   Behavior pattern:
        
        *   Chain of Responsibility: By delegating requests from an object to the next object in the chain until the request is processed, decoupling between objects is achieved. Such as javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter().
        *   Command mode: encapsulates operations into objects for storage, delivery, and return, such as: java.lang.Runnable.
        *   Interpreter mode: defines the syntax of a language, and then parses the corresponding syntax statement, such as java.text.Format, java.text.Normalizer.
        *   Iterator mode: Provides a consistent method for sequentially accessing objects in a collection, such as java.util.Iterator.
        *   Mediator pattern: java.lang.reflect.Method#invoke() by using an intermediate object for message distribution and reducing the direct dependency between classes.
        *   Empty object patterns: such as java.util.Collections#emptyList().
        *   Observer pattern: It allows an object to send messages to interested objects flexibly, such as java.util.EventListener.
        *   Template method pattern: Allows subclasses to override part of the method instead of the entire rewrite, such as java.util.Collections#sort().

*   [Spring AOP Implementation Principles and CGLIB Applications](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/java/j-lo-springaopcglib/)
    *   The principle of handling the AOP proxy class in the Spring AOP framework is: If the target object's implementation class implements the interface, Spring AOP will use the JDK dynamic proxy to generate the AOP proxy class; if the target object's implementation class does not implement the interface, Spring AOP will Use CGLIB to generate AOP proxy classes

    *   Law 2: Time is not possible to do more perfect one thing, but there is always time to finish one thing. Can't get fat in one go, but you can get it first.
    *   Law 3: There are potentially heterogeneous homomorphic characteristics between linear systems and linear organizational structures. Get melons and become independent autonomous subsystems to reduce communication costs.
    *   Law 4: Large system organizations are always more decomposed than small systems. All the time will be divided, divide and rule.

    *   Nginx achieves high concurrency through asynchronous non-blocking event handling mechanisms. Apache monopolizes one thread per request and consumes system resources.
    *   Event-driven is suitable for IO intensive services (Nginx), multi-process or thread-adapted to CPU-intensive services (Apache), so Nginx is suitable for reverse proxy, not web server use.
*   ["Comparisons and advantages and disadvantages of nginx and Apache"](https://www.cnblogs.com/cunkouzh/p/5410154.html)

    *   Tomcat is a lightweight Serverlet container that does not implement all JEE features (such as persistence and transaction processing) but can be replaced by other components such as Srping.
    *   Jboss implements all JEE features, free software open source, and documentation fees.

#### [](#调优方案)Tuning plan

*   [Tomcat Tuning Solution](https://www.cnblogs.com/sunfenqing/p/7339058.html)
    
    *   Start NIO mode (or APR); adjust thread pool; disable AJP connector (Nginx+tomcat architecture, no AJP required);

*   [AJP vs. HTTP Comparison and Analysis](http://dmouse.iteye.com/blog/1354527)
    
    *   The AJP protocol (port 8009) is used to reduce the number of connections (front-end) to the front-end Server (such as Apache, which also needs to support the AJP protocol), and to increase performance through long connections.
    *   When concurrency is high, the AJP protocol is better than the HTTP protocol.

*   ["Compared advantages of jetty and tomcat"](https://blog.csdn.net/doutao6677/article/details/51957288)
    *   Architecture comparison: Jetty's architecture is much simpler than Tomcat's.
    *   Performance comparison: Jetty and Tomcat have little difference in performance. Jetty uses NIO to end up with more advantages in handling I/O requests. Tomcat uses BIO to handle I/O requests by default. Tomcat is suitable for handling a few very busy links and handles static resources. Poor performance.
    *   Other aspects: The application of Jetty is faster, simpler to modify, and better supported by the new Servlet specification; Tomcat supports JEE and Servlet more comprehensively.

    *   The slab allocation algorithm: memcached allocates memory space for Slab, the default is 1MB. After allocating to Slab, the slab of the slab is divided into chunks of the same size. Chunk is the memory space used to cache the records. The chunk size is incremented by 1.25 times by default. The advantage is that it will not frequently apply for memory and improve IO efficiency. The disadvantage is that there will be a certain amount of memory waste.

*   Architecture: Similar to the design concept of Hadoop, Configserver, DataServer, and Configserver are used to detect heartbeats. Configserver also has a master/slave relationship.

Several storage engines:

*   MDB, full memory, can be used to store data such as Session.
*   Rdb (similar to Redis), lightweight, removes operations like aof, supports Restfull operations
*   LDB (LevelDB storage engine), persistent storage, LDB as a persistence of rdb, google implementation, more efficient, theoretical basis is the LSM (Log-Structured-Merge Tree) algorithm, now modify the data in memory, reach a certain amount (and Memory aggregated old data is written to disk together.

    *   Five I/O models: Blocking I/O, Non-blocking I/O, I/O Multiplexing, Event (Signal) Driven I/O, Asynchronous I/O, and the first four I/Os are synchronous operations, I/O The first stage of O is the same and the second stage is the same. The last one belongs to asynchronous operation.

*   [Summary of differences between select, poll, and epoll](http://www.cnblogs.com/Anker/p/3265058.html)
    
    *   Select, poll, and epoll are essentially synchronous I/O because they all need to be responsible for reading and writing after the read/write event is ready. This means that the read/write process is blocked.
    *   Select has a limit on the number of open file descriptors, the default is 1024 (2048 for x64), 1 million concurrent, 1000 processes will be used, and the switching overhead is large; poll uses the linked list structure, and there is no limit to the number.
    *   Select, poll "wake up" when iterating over the entire fd collection, and epoll "wake up" as long as the judgment is ready list is empty, through the callback mechanism to save a lot of CPU time; select, poll call every time To copy the fd set from the user state to the kernel state, epoll only needs to copy once.
    *   With the increase of concurrent poll, the performance gradually declines. Epoll adopts the red-black tree structure and has stable performance. It will not decrease as the number of connections increases.
*   ["select, poll, epoll comparison"](http://xingyunbaijunwei.blog.163.com/blog/static/76538067201241685556302/)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   ["Talking about my understanding of DDD-driven design"](https://www.cnblogs.com/netfocus/p/5548025.html)
    
    *   Concept: DDD is mainly proposed for the separation of the various stages of the traditional software development process (Analysis-Design-Code) to avoid undeliverable software (and requirements) due to unclear analysis at first or inconsistent information flow during software development. Assuming inconsistencies). DDD emphasizes that everything is centered on the domain and emphasizes the role of Domain Expert. It emphasizes that the domain model is first defined and then developed, and the domain model can guide the development (the so-called driver).
    *   Process: Understanding the domain, splitting the domain, refining the domain, the accuracy of the model depends on the depth of understanding of the model.
    *   Design: DDD proposes modeling tools such as aggregations, entities, value objects, factories, warehousing, domain services, and domain events to help with domain modeling.
*   ["Summary of Domain Driven Design Basics"](https://www.cnblogs.com/butterfly100/p/7827870.html)
    
    *   Domain (Doamin) is essentially a problem domain, such as an e-commerce system, a forum system, etc.
    *   Bounded Context: Explains the relationship between subdomains and can be simply understood as a subsystem or component module.
    *   Domain Model: The core of DDD is to establish the correct domain model (using universal description language, tools, and domain common language); to reflect the nature of business requirements, including entities and processes; it runs through software analysis, design, and development. Process; commonly used expression field model: diagram, code or text;
    *   Domain common language: Domain experts, developers and designers can have immediate language or tools.
    *   The classic layered architecture: user interface/presentation layer, application layer, domain layer, and infrastructure layer is a four-tier architecture model.
    *   The mode used:
        *   Link as little as possible, as far as possible single item, try to reduce the overall complexity.
        *   Entity: The only indication in the domain that an entity has as few attributes as possible and at least as clear.
        *   Value Object: There is no unique identifier, and the property value is immutable. The second is a simple object, such as Date.
        *   Domain Service: Coordinate multiple domain objects, only the method has no state (no data); it can be divided into application layer services, domain layer services, and basic layer services.
        *   Aggregate, Aggregate Root: Aggregate defines a set of related objects with a cohesive relationship; the aggregate root is the only element of the aggregate reference; when modifying an aggregate, it must be at the transaction level; most areas In the model, 70% of aggregates usually have only one entity, and 30% only have 2 to 3 entities; if an aggregate has only one entity, then this entity is the aggregate root; if there are multiple entities, then we can think about which object in the aggregate Has independent significance and can interact with the outside directly;
        *   Factory: Similar to the factory mode in design mode.
        *   Repository: Persisting to DB, managing objects, and designing storage only for aggregates.

    *   Anemia model: Laozi knows son, son also knows Laozi; part of the business logic is put into the entity; Advantages: Individual layers of dependent, structural clear, easy to maintain; Disadvantages: does not meet the OO thinking, compared to the congestion model, the service layer is more heavy ;
    *   Congestion model: Similar to the anemia model, the difference lies in how to divide the business logic. Advantages: The service layer is relatively thin, only acts as a facade, does not deal with DAO, compound OO thinking; disadvantages: non-single dependency, bi-directional dependency between DO and DAO, and logical division of the Service layer is likely to cause confusion.
    *   Swollen mode: It is an extreme situation, cancel the service layer, all the business logic in DO; Advantages: in line with OO ideas, simplification of layering; Disadvantages: too much exposure information, many non-DO logic will be forced into DO. This pattern should be avoided.
